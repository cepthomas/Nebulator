# What This Is
Most music software uses piano roll midi editors. This is an alternative - writing scripts to generate sounds.

I played around with various scripting concepts, but ended up realizing that C# makes a reasonable scripting language, given that we have the compiler available to us at run time.

It supports midi and OSC.

While the primary intent is to generate music-by-code, runtime interaction is also supported. It's called Nebulator after a MarkS C++ noisemaker called Nebula which allowed manipulation of parameters using custom UI inputs.

The script syntax is roughly based on that used by [Processing](https://processing.org/), combined with C# language features.

# Bonus Stuff
This project contains a bunch of components that are either recycled or created for this. Most could be stripped out for subsequent reuse.
- A theoretically better multimedia timer with improved accuracy for sub 10 msec period.
- Midi classes may be useful elsewhere in conjunction with NAudio.
- Partial import of Yahama style (.sty) files.
- Multiple file change watcher.
- General purpose embedded C# in memory compiler.
- Virtual keyboard control based on Leslie Sanford's piano.
- Various utilities and extensions.
- Simple charting control.
- Example of the use of [pnut unit tester](https://github.com/cepthomas/pnut)
