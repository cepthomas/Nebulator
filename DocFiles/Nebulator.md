# Nebulator

## Usage
- Top pane is the global transport control and channel controls.
- Bottom pane is log and comm tracing. Note that comm tracing has an impact on performance so use it judiciously.
- Basically open a .neb file, press compile, then run.
- Rather than spending the effort on a built-in script editor, use your favorite external text editor. The application will watch for
  changes you make and indicate that recompile is needed. I use Sublime - you can associate .neb files with C# for pretty-close syntax coloring.


## Example Script Files
See the Examples directory for material while perusing the docs.
