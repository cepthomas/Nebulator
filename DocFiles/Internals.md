# Internals

- VS 2019 solution, targets .NET5 WinForms.
- Uses Roslyn for in-memory compilation.
- No installer yet, it's a build-it-yerself for now. Eventually a nuget package might be created.
- Settings and log are in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Ephemera\Nebulator`.

## Design

- Three projects. `Common` and `BaseScript` are compiled separately into assemblies
  so that they can be linked with the compiled user script dynamically.
- Main UI and non user script stuff is all in the `App` project.
- Channels and Controllers follow the midi model. Devices represent ports (and corresponding physical dvices.)
- You can have up to 16 Channels attached to each IOutputDevice.
- There is one ChannelControl per Channel.

## Bonus Stuff
This project contains a bunch of components that are either recycled or created for this. Chunks could be stripped out for subsequent reuse.

- Midi and OSC classes may be useful elsewhere in conjunction with NAudio.
- Embedded Roslyn in-memory compiler.
- See [NBagOfTricks](https://github.com/cepthomas/NBagOfTricks) for more goodies.


## Third Party

# Diagrams

Diagrams can be inserted alongside, as in this      ****************************
example, or between paragraphs of text as shown     * .---------.              *
below.                                              * |  Server |<------.      *
                                                    * '----+----'       |      *
The diagram parser leaves symbols used as labels    *      |            |      *
unmodified, so characters like > and ( can appear   *      | DATA CYCLE |      *
inside of the diagram. In fact, any plain text      *      v            |      *
may appear in the diagram. In addition to labels,   *  .-------.   .----+----. *
any un-beautified text will remain in place for     * | Security|  |  File   | *
use as ASCII art. Thus, the diagram is rarely       * | Policy  +->| Manager | *
distored by the beautification process.             *  '-------'   '---------' *
                                                    ****************************
