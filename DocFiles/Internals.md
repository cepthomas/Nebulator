# Internals

- VS 2019 solution, targets .NET5 WinForms.
- Uses Roslyn for in-memory compilation.
- No installer yet, it's a build-it-yerself for now. Eventually a nuget package might be created.
- Settings and log are in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Ephemera\Nebulator`.

## Design TODO1

- assemblies -> user script
- N Channels to each IOutputDevice
- 1 ChannelControl per Channel
- LogLevel: Trace Debug Info Warn Error Fatal Off

## Bonus Stuff
This project contains a bunch of components that are either recycled or created for this. Chunks could be stripped out for subsequent reuse.

- Midi and OSC classes may be useful elsewhere in conjunction with NAudio.
- Embedded Roslyn in-memory compiler.
- See [NBagOfTricks](https://github.com/cepthomas/NBagOfTricks) for more goodies.
