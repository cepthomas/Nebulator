# Internals

- VS 2019 solution, targets .NET6 WinForms.
- Uses Roslyn for in-memory compilation.
- No installer yet, it's a build-it-yerself for now. Eventually a nuget package might be created.
- Settings and log are in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Ephemera\Nebulator`.

## Design

- Three projects. `Common` and `Script` are compiled separately into assemblies
  so that they can be linked with the compiled user script dynamically.
- Main UI and non user script stuff is all in the `App` project.
- Channels and Controllers follow the midi model. Devices represent ports (and corresponding physical dvices.)
- You can have up to 16 Channels attached to each IOutputDevice.
- There is one ChannelControl per Channel.

## Midi Controllers

Nebulator adds a couple of hidden controller values for internal use.

Controller          | Number |
----------          | ------ |
NoteControl         | 250    |
PitchControl        | 251    |


## Bonus Stuff
This project contains a bunch of components that are either recycled or created for this. Chunks could be stripped out for subsequent reuse.

- Midi and OSC classes may be useful elsewhere in conjunction with NAudio.
- Embedded Roslyn in-memory compiler.
