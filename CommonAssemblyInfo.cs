using System.Reflection;

// This file comprises the common parts of the AssemblyInfo.cs for the Nebulator assemblies.
// The main purpose is to ensure all generated assemblies have the same major/minor version
// number, which can be set manually below prior to building. Note that setting the * forces
// the Build number to be the number of days since Dec 31, 1999 and the Revision number is
// the number of seconds since midnight, divided by 2.
// Suppressing AssemblyFileVersion causes it to take the same value as AssemblyVersion.

// To use it in your project, remove these lines from your AssemblyInfo.cs:
[assembly: AssemblyCompany("Ephemera")]
[assembly: AssemblyCopyright("MIT License")]
[assembly: AssemblyTrademark("")]
[assembly: AssemblyCulture("")]
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0")]

// Add a note: Version information is supplied by CommonAssemblyInfo.cs.

// Next, you need to link this common file into your projects right beside your edited AssemblyInfo.cs file.
// To do this, right click on your project and choose Add | Existing Item from the context menu.
// Navigate to this file but instead of clicking Add, click the little down-arrow 
// next to add and choose "Add as Link".
